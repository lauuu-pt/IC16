In this project, we designed an interactive prototype for the **DigitalEmployee** application, created for the fast-food chain **Kyoto Sushi**. The goal was to develop an innovative and user-friendly interface that allows customers to **browse the interactive menu**, view **food origins, nutritional information, and allergens**, and **place and track orders**. Additionally, users can **review past visits and invoices**, and **reserve tables or pre-order meals**, paying individually or as a group. Our focus was on delivering a creative and engaging user experience, ensuring smooth navigation, intuitive interaction, and appealing visual presentation suitable for both computers and tablets.
